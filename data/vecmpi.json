  "problem_description": "Write a PETSc test, which creates a PETSc VECMPI vector x, and initializes it with values 1.0, 2.0, ..., N, where N = 10 is an input argument (-N 10) for the size of the vector. Then the test scales the vector x by 2.0. After that, the test uses the PETSc's VecScatter functionality to gather the vector at MPI process 0 to a VECSEQ vector y, and print out the values there. Run the test with 3 MPI processes.",
