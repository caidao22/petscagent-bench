  "problem_description": "Write a PETSc test, which creates a PETSc VECMPIKOKKOS vector x, and initializes it with values 1.0, 2.0, ..., N, where N = 10 is an input argument (-N 10) for the size of the vector. Then the test gets a Kokkos View of the vector data and launch a Kokkos kernel that doubles each element of the vector. After that, the test uses the PETSc's VecScatter functionality to gather the vector at MPI process 0 to a VECSEQKOKKOS vector y, and print out the values there. It should only generate a .kokkos.cpp file and leverage PETSc's makefile support for Kokkos to build the code.",
