  "problem_description": "Write a single, compilable C program that solves the steady-state 2D Darcy flow equation on the unit square using a conforming finite element method (FEM) and PETSc KSP.\n\nPhysics (Elliptic PDE, nondimensional):\n  -∇ · (k(x,y) ∇u(x,y)) = f(x,y),\nwhere u(x,y) is the pressure field, k(x,y) is the permeability field, and f(x,y) is the source term.\n\nSetup:\n- Domain: unit square D = (0,1)×(0,1).\n- Mesh: structured or unstructured 2D mesh of triangles or quadrilaterals covering D.\n- Boundary conditions: u = 0 on all boundaries (Dirichlet on ∂D).\n- Permeability k(x,y): piecewise constant field:\n  * k = 10.0 inside the circle centered at (0.5, 0.5) of radius 0.2.\n  * k = 1.0 elsewhere.\n- Source term f(x,y): Gaussian source centered at (0.5, 0.5):\n  * f(x,y) = exp(-50 * ((x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2)).\n\nRequirements:\n1) Discretization: use a standard conforming finite element method for the weak form of the PDE.\n   - Use continuous scalar basis functions (e.g., piecewise linear Lagrange elements) for u.\n   - Assemble the global linear system A u = b corresponding to the variational form:\n       ∫_D k(x,y) ∇u · ∇v dx dy = ∫_D f(x,y) v dx dy,   for all test functions v vanishing on ∂D.\n   - Incorporate the Dirichlet condition u=0 on ∂D strongly (e.g., by modifying rows of A and entries of b).\n2) Implementation in PETSc: either\n   - Use DMPLEX to define the finite element space, coefficients k and f, and automatically assemble A and b; or\n   - Manually assemble A and b by looping over elements and quadrature points.\n   Document the choice in comments.\n3) Solver: use PETSc KSP to solve A u = b (e.g., conjugate gradient with multigrid preconditioning), with solver options configurable from the command line.\n4) Output: after solving, compute and print the L2 norm of u over the domain.\n\nImplementation:\n- Single C source file, no external dependencies beyond PETSc.\n- main() must initialize PETSc, create the mesh and FE discretization, assemble A and b, solve A u = b with KSP, print the L2 norm, and finalize PETSc.",
