# PETSc Code Evaluation System
## Summary of Changes

Comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing generated PETSc code across multiple dimensions.
### Architecture Changes
- **Removed CompilationGate** from Phase 1
- Reduced total gates from 4 to 3
- Updated gate counts throughout the document

## Overview
### Specific Modifications

The evaluation system categorizes metrics into three types:
1. **Architecture diagram** - Removed `CompilationGate` line
2. **Gates count** - Changed from "Gates (4 total)" to "Gates (3 total)"
3. **Gates list** - Removed "✅ **Compilation** - Code compiles without errors"
4. **Output format** - Updated gate counts in JSON examples from `"passed": 4, "total": 4` to `"passed": 3, "total": 3`




## Rationale


This change makes sense because:
- Compilation is already verified before the evaluation pipeline runs (in the Green Agent's compile step)
- The `execution_result` parameter already includes a `compiles` field, indicating compilation happens externally
- Removes redundancy in the evaluation flow
